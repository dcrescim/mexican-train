# Welcome to the Mexican Train Bot Challenge!

Hello, family and friends! Welcome to our unique and exciting project: The Mexican Train Bot Challenge. If you've ever lost a game of Mexican Train, and thought "I can write a fucking bot so that I never lose again", this competition is for you! This repository is the home for a fun project where each of us will create a bot to play the popular dominoes game, Mexican Train. The goal is simple: code the smartest, most strategic bot that can outplay the rest!

## What is Mexican Train?

Mexican Train is a domino game, traditionally played with family and friends, but also can be enjoyed with enemies. The objective is to build a 'train' of dominoes while trying to get rid of all your pieces. It's fun, strategic, and now, it's going to be a battleground for our bots!

## Challenge Overview

Task: Write a bot that can play Mexican Train.
Language: Python
Winning Criteria: The bot that wins the most games in a tournament.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository locally. Make sure you have python versions > 3. There is one file called game.py. It houses all of the game logic. At the bottom you will see a class called `MexicanTrainBot`. Your bots will extend that class. To give you an example, you will see an implementation called `RandomPlayerAgent` that picks a valid move at random each time it has a turn. Read that code and the other code (which, together, means all of the code) to understand how you should extend `MexicanTrainBot` to structure your bot.

Understand the Rules: Make sure you are familiar with the rules of Mexican Train. Here's a link to the [rules](https://www.mastersofgames.com/rules/mexican-train-dominoes-rules.htm).

Test Your Bot: At the bottom of that file you will see me create a game with 4 random bots. Feel free to play your bot against itself or the random bot to see which strategies work the best.

The competition starts January 1st, and ends on January 17th.

## Rules and Guidelines

Fair Play: No hacking or unfair tactics. The goal is to have fun and learn.
Collaboration: Feel free to collaborate, but each submission should be primarily your own work.

## Timeline

Start Date: January 1st
Submission Deadline: January 14th
Tournament Date: January 18th

## Have Fun!

Remember, the primary goal of this challenge is to have fun and maybe learn a bit about programming and strategy along the way. So, don't stress, and let your creativity flow!

Happy coding, and may the best bot win!
